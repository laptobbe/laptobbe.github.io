<p>App design is hard! At least if you have a development background like me. There are a lot of things you have to take into account in any design. So to start to learn app design I did what I often do when faced with a new problem. I started looking for new tools. In this case I had heard from people I worked with about an app called <a href="http://sketchapp.com">Sketch</a>, and it came with warm recommendations. So I decided to give it a go. Previously I had tried, with little result, Photoshop and Illustrator. So was very excited to see what this app could do differently.</p>

<p>In this post I will share my experience with Sketch. Some issues, tips and additional resources I have encountered while working with it.</p>

<h1 id="briefing:312c49ee3585d8844801754d97ccfcd7">Briefing</h1>

<p>My first step, when learning a new tool, is always to watch and/or read a tutorial. That&rsquo;s only half true though because I never watch a complete tutorial. I really like the idea of making the mistakes myself and I really love solving all the problems that arises. In this case though it might not be true at all because I just downloaded the app and started using with it.</p>

<p>In my experience it is always better to have a project in mind when starting to work with a new tool. This gives you a goal of what you want to achieve, it also makes it more real in some way. If you don&rsquo;t have a goal in mind, you will end up just &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with it.</p>

<p>In this case it was quite easy for me. I already had a iOS project that I wanted to work with. A goal/task manager for iPhone, iPad and Mac codename &ldquo;Allan&rdquo;. This project would let me explore a lot of different sizes and layouts (I will write about &ldquo;Allan&rdquo; in a different post, if I don&rsquo;t drop the project as I usually do).</p>

<h1 id="first-blood:312c49ee3585d8844801754d97ccfcd7">First blood</h1>

<p>Starting up Sketch I found that there was a template with iOS components, great! Next I created a new art board and conveniently there was predefined sizes for iPhone (and a lot of other sizes including iPad sizes). I started copying components from the template to my art board, and changing their sizes and colors I soon realized that everything was changing in the original component. Same went for text I changed in my copied elements. This was apparently a feature not a bug. The elements I copied were of a type called Symbols. What you have to do is to <em>detach</em> it from the original.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sketch1.png" alt="Sketch context menu ’Detach from Symbol’" />
</p>

<p>After this initial hurtle I have not run into any major problems. And It has a some features I like;</p>

<ul>
<li>It is easy to manage the layers.</li>
<li>Drag n’ drop existing bitmaps or vector I onto the canvas.</li>
<li>It opens even very large Sketch documents fast. <em>Amazing!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Sketch is light years ahead of Photoshop in my mind and for a fraction of the price.</p>

<p>I also know it has a lot of features for exporting different sizes appropriate for iOS development. But I have not yet used these features (I am still designing my first app with it). So I will not comment on them yet.</p>

<h1 id="tips:312c49ee3585d8844801754d97ccfcd7">Tips</h1>

<p>If you are like me you will just jump right in and skip all the intros. Definitely works it is intuitive enough for that. However I almost forgot the had an intro. After a while it was valuable to refer back to this intro.</p>

<p>In doing so I also found their <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/12-importing/">support site</a>. Which I have yet to use, but it seems to go into comprehensive detail for everything you might want to accomplish .</p>

<p>I might be back later with a further review. To round up I want to recommend a webpage called <a href="http://www.sketchappsources.com">Sketchapp Sources</a> I found that has a lot of resources for Sketch. Found a lot of iOS resources there. I always used <em>teehan+lax</em> iOS components when trying to use Photoshop, and they have made a <a href="http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/933-ios8-gui-elements-sketch-freebie-resource.html">version</a> for sketch as well.</p>
