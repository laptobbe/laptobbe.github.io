App design is hard! At least if you have a development background like me. There are a lot of things you have to take into account in any design. So to start to learn app design I did what I often do when faced with a new problem. I started looking for new tools. In this case I had heard from people I worked with about an app called [Sketch](http://sketchapp.com), and it came with warm recommendations. So I decided to give it a go. Previously I had tried, with little result, Photoshop and Illustrator. So was very excited to see what this app could do differently.

In this post I will share my experience with Sketch. Some issues, tips and additional resources I have encountered while working with it.

# Briefing
My first step, when learning a new tool, is always to watch and/or read a tutorial. That's only half true though because I never watch a complete tutorial. I really like the idea of making the mistakes myself and I really love solving all the problems that arises. In this case though it might not be true at all because I just downloaded the app and started using with it. 

In my experience it is always better to have a project in mind when starting to work with a new tool. This gives you a goal of what you want to achieve, it also makes it more real in some way. If you don't have a goal in mind, you will end up just "playing" with it.

In this case it was quite easy for me. I already had a iOS project that I wanted to work with. A goal/task manager for iPhone, iPad and Mac codename "Allan". This project would let me explore a lot of different sizes and layouts (I will write about "Allan" in a different post, if I don't drop the project as I usually do).

# First blood
Starting up Sketch I found that there was a template with iOS components, great! Next I created a new art board and conveniently there was predefined sizes for iPhone (and a lot of other sizes including iPad sizes). I started copying components from the template to my art board, and changing their sizes and colors I soon realized that everything was changing in the original component. Same went for text I changed in my copied elements. This was apparently a feature not a bug. The elements I copied were of a type called Symbols. What you have to do is to *detach* it from the original.

After this initial hurtle I have not run into any major problems. And It has a some features I like;

* It is easy to manage the layers.
* Drag n’ drop existing bitmaps or vector I onto the canvas. 
* It opens even very large Sketch documents fast. *Amazing!*

Sketch is light years ahead of Photoshop in my mind and for a fraction of the price.

I also know it has a lot of features for exporting different sizes appropriate for iOS development. But I have not yet used these features (I am still designing my first app with it). So I will not comment on them yet.

# Tips
If you are like me you will just jump right in and skip all the intros. Definitely works it is intuitive enough for that. However I almost forgot the had an intro. After a while it was valuable to refer back to this intro.

In doing so I also found their [support site](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/12-importing/). Which I have yet to use, but it seems to go into comprehensive detail for everything you might want to accomplish .

I might be back later with a further review. To round up I want to recommend a webpage called [Sketchapp Sources](http://www.sketchappsources.com) I found that has a lot of resources for Sketch. Found a lot of iOS resources there. I always used *teehan+lax* iOS components when trying to use Photoshop, and they have made a [version](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/933-ios8-gui-elements-sketch-freebie-resource.html) for sketch as well.
